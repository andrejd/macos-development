### Python development on macOS High Sierra
---

> macOS High Sierra already comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed and can be used as it is. If you need to use latest version of Python3, you need to install it.

####  Python3 installation

While macOS comes with a large number of UNIX utilities, those familiar with Linux systems will notice one key component missing, a package manager. `Homebrew` fills this void.

To install Homebrew, open Terminal and run 

```bash
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

The script will explain what changes it will make and prompt you before the installation begins. Once youâ€™ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
```

Now, we can install Python 3:

```bash
$ brew install python3
```
This will take a minute or two. After that you are read to go.
